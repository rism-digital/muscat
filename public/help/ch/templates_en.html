<p>The cataloguing software offers the possibility of selecting some preset templates, depending on the kind of source catalogued. The preselection leaves in the input mask only those fields that are actually used. For example, the field "Link to items in this source (772 $w)" appears only in the templates for collections, as it is not used for single records.</p>

<p>Another work-saving distinction is made between manuscript or printed sources, attributed and anonymous sources. In anonymous works, no field with the composer's name appears. </p>
 
<p>When creating a new record, the following templates can be selected: </p>


<ul>
	<li>Blank (control tags only)</li>
	<li>Convolutum</li>
	<li>Manuscript Collection</li>
	<li>Printed Collection</li>
	<li><em>Music manuscripts</em></li>
	<ul>	
		<li>Anonymous work</li>
		<li>Anonymous work in collection</li>
		<li>Attributed work</li>
		<li>Attributed work in collection</li>
	</ul>		
	<li><em>Printed works</em></li>
	<ul>	
		<li>Anonymous work</li>
		<li>Anonymous work in collection</li>
		<li>Attributed work</li>
		<li>Attributed work in collection</li>
		</ul>
	<li><em>Libretti</em></li>
	<ul>	
		<li>Libretto anonymous, manuscript</li>
		<li>Libretto anonymous, printed</li>
		<li>Libretto attributed, manuscript</li>
		<li>Libretto attributed, printed</li>
		</ul>
	<li><em>Theoretica</em></li>
	<ul>	
		<li>Theoretica anonymous</li>
		<li>Theoretica attributed</li>
	</ul>	
</ul>


<p>The template "Blank (control tags only)" contains all fields of all templates and is used only if in a certain template a required field is missing. </p>


<h3>Copying existing records </h3>

<p>In addition to the selection of different templates, an existing record can be imported into the entrance screen. To this end, it is sufficient to enter the corresponding RISM ID number in the provided entry field "Existing title". After confirming with a click on the button "Create", a new record of the desireded title will appear, that will automatically receive a new RISM ID number on saving.</p>
