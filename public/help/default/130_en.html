<h4>Standardised title (130/240 $a) </h4>

<p>The standardised title (ST) is a filing title. The values can be chosen from the drop-down list. The ST is used to group all identical or similar compositions even if they have different denominations in the sources. It is not possible to enter a doubtful title. Both square and round brackets are prohibited. </p>

<p>A standardised title can be generated from: </p>

<ol>
<li><em>Individual titles </em></li>
<li><em>Text incipits </em></li>
<li><em>Musical genres</em></li>
<li><em>Tempo markings and other standardised titles </em></li>
</ol>

<p>1. <em>Individual titles </em></p>

<p>The individual title is given following the original version, but in a standardised spelling. Standards are set according to a) the New Grove, b) the MGG, c) work catalogues, d) other reference works. </p>

<p>Generally, all kinds of music theatre, oratorios, cantatas, and lieder, but also instrumental works with a well-defined title (e.g., character pieces from the 18th century) are filed under their individual titles. </p>

<p>Definite and indefinite articles are postponed, separated by a comma and capitalized. Title of music prints and popular names (e.g., "Eroica", "Nelson Mass", etc.) do not count as STs. Such names are entered in the field "Additional title (730 $a)". </p>

<p>Special rules apply for collections. A collection of several individual pieces is indicated in this field as "Collection". A collection which contains at least one "Collection" and a single title and/or other "Collections" is called a "Convolutum". In these cases a comment about the contents of the collection can be entered in the field "Note on content (505)". </p>

<p>2. <em>Text incipit</em></p>

<p>If a vocal work has no individual title, the text incipit takes its place. In this case, the indication must correspond with the entry in the subfield "Text incipit (031 $t)" in spelling and length. </p>

<p>If a manuscript contains a recitative and aria or a similar formal sequence with recitative, the ST is the text incipit of the aria. </p>

<p>Masses, Requiems, obsequies, litanies and compositions for the hours of the office are always filed under their genre. The same is true for complete operas and oratorios whose individual title is unknown. </p>

<p>If the individual title of an opera from which a single aria is excerpted is unknown, the ST of the aria is its text incipit.</p>

<p>The language of the individual title determines the use of upper or lower case letters. Designations for "God" are always capitalized, e.g. Dieu, Dio, Deus, Lord, etc. </p>

<p>Punctuation and repetitions are not included in the individual title. If the item is clearly a translation, the standardised title will be entered, if possible, in the original language. </p>

<p>3. <em>Genre </em></p>

<p>If neither an individual title nor a text incipit is applicable as ST, the corresponding genre will be entered. The genre as ST is generally entered in English and in the plural.</p>

<p>4. <em>Tempo markings and other STs</em></p>

<p>If no genre can be determined, a generic designation for the work or a tempo marking will be used as ST: </p>

<ul>
	<li>Instrumental pieces </li>
	<li>Vocal pieces</li>
	<li>Pieces (if no narrower definition is applicable)</li>
	<li>Andante</li>
</ul>



<h4>Subheading (130/240 $k) </h4>

<p>A note on special formal aspects of works is entered here. The following entries are possible: </p>
<ul>
	<li>"Excerpts"</li>
	<li>"Sketches"</li>
	<li>"Fragments"</li>
</ul>

<p>Further information can be added in the field "Note on content (505)".</p>


<h4>Arrangement statement (130/240 $o) </h4>

<p>If the present work is an arrangement of another work, "Arr" is entered in this subfield. </p>

<strong>Caution!</strong> Retextings and transpositions are not considered arrangements. In such a case, the name of the responsible person, if known, is indicated under "Additional personal names (700 $a)". Although the works are not considered arrangements, the person is referred to there as "Arranger". </p>

<p>Arrangements should also be distinguished from independent works (free elaborations), such as variations, paraphrases, parodies, and fantasies on themes from the original work. </p>


<h4>Key (130/240 $r) </h4>

<p>The key of the complete work is entered here according to the list of abbreviations. This applies also to modes. The subfield is not repeatable. Keys refer to the entire work (also in "Excerpts") and arrangements of the original work. For large vocal works (operas, oratorios, cantatas), except for Masses, no key is specified. </p>

<p>The key can be omitted if it is not possible to determine it with certainty, e.g. in recitatives. If no key is indicated on the source, it may only be added if can be determined with certainty. </p>


<h4>Opus/thematic catalogue no. (130/240 $n) </h4>

<p>The indication of the thematic catalogue consists of the abbreviation for the catalogue, followed by a blank space and a number (if necessary with slash, etc.). This must correspond with the indication entered in the field "Catalogue name (690 $a)" as retrieved from the authority file. </p>

<p>If also an opus number is known, it is added separating it with a comma from the catalogue number. </p>

<p>E.g. (Beethoven): </p>

<ul>
	<li>KinB 48/1, op. 48/1</li>
</ul>


<h4>Scoring summary (130/240 $m) </h4>

<p>The scoring summary should briefly state the general scoring, which is entered extensively in the field "Scoring (coded instrumentation) (594 $a-n)". The individual voices are assigned to a group. Only a maximum of four groups are allowed, separated by a comma. </p>

<p>The abbreviations from the list are applicable. In addition, also the following collective names can be used:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Coro</li>
	<li>strings</li>
	<li>woodwinds</li>
	<li>brasses</li>
	<li>winds</li>
	<li>orch</li>
	<li>plck</li>
	<li>stck</li>
	<li>bc.fig</li>
</ul>

<p>The order of the indications follows that of the field "Scoring (coded instrumentation) (594 $a-n)": solo voices, chorus, solo instruments, strings, woodwinds, brass, plucked instruments, percussion, keyboards, other instruments and finally basso continuo. </p>

<p>Several vocal parts of the same range are indicated in parentheses, e.g.  "B (2)". For a single voice it is not necessary to indicate a number. A vocal part of unknown range is indicated with "V". If there are several vocal ranges, or the vocal parts are unknown, the number is given in parentheses, e.g. "V (8)". An unknown number of vocal parts is indicated with an "(X)" following the name of the vocal range.</p>

<p>Only solo instruments having a solo part against an orchestra throughout a piece (especially in a solo concert) will be indicated as iSol, not parts emerging from the tutti with occasional solo passages (e.g., an oboe solo in the movement of a cantata). </p>

<p>The term 'i' indicates an unknown individual instrumental voice. Several unknown instruments are indicated with "i (number)", while a greater ensemble will always be referred to as "orch".</p>

<p>E.g.: </p>

<ul>
	<li>Mass: 	V (4), Coro, orch, org</li>
	<li>Lied:	Bariton, pf</li>
	<li>Flute concert:	fl, orch</li>
	<li>String quartet:	vl (2), vla, vlc</li>
</ul>
