<h4>Musical incipit (031)</h4>

<p>A musical incipit is considered a unit without interruptions. It reflects a portion of the whole work. Generally, at least one incipit of an instrumental line and of the vocal line is included.</p>

<p><strong>Caution!</strong> Transposing instruments are notated at sounding pitch. See the related section in the work aid.</p>

<h4>Number (031 $a)</h4>

<p>The incipit number consists of three numbers separated by periods, which stand for the piece, the movement and the incipit. Incipits with different numbers at the end but identical numbers in the second position indicate that they sound simultaneously. Different numbers in the third position can also be used when: 1. the introduction and 2. the entrance of the vocal part are indicated.</p>

<p>E.g.:</p>
<ul>
	<li>1.1.1 &ndash; 1st piece, 1st movement, 1st incipit</li>
	<li>1.1.2 &ndash; 1st piece, 1st movement, 2nd incipit (sounding simultaneously with 1.1.1, or entry of the vocal line)</li>
	<li>1.2.1 &ndash; 1st piece, 2nd movement, 1st incipit </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Caution!</strong> Even if incipits are omitted, the numbering is still consecutive. E.g., if in a source (for a four-movement symphony) the middle movements are missing, the first incipit from the 1st movement is labelled 1.1.1. The second incipit is labelled 1.2.1, not 1.4.1, even though it is taken from the 4th movement!</p>

<h4>Caption of heading (031 $d)</h4>

<p>The title of the movement is given in the original spelling, i.e. line breaks are indicated by "/". The use of square brackets for researched titles is allowed; within a closed set of sources these should be written in standardised spelling.</p>

<p>If a movement has more than one title, the subfield may be repeated. The same applies for additional tempo markings.</p>

<p>If the indication does not change in the course of the movement, the title, respectively the tempo marking is indicated only for the 1st incipit.</p>

<p>If no tempo is specified on the source, the field remains blank.</p>

<h4>Voice/instrument (031 $m)</h4>

<p>The scoring of the incipit is specified following the list of abbreviations. Transposing instruments are notated at sounding pitch. The pitch of the instrument is mentioned in the "General note (031 $q)".</p>

<h4>Role (031 $e)</h4>

<p>This field indicates the role corresponding to the incipit. Square brackets indicate an addition, a question mark an uncertain role.</p>

<h4>Text incipit (031 $t)</h4>

In order to match the text and musical incipits, the information from 740 $a need to be repeated here. The text incipits are selected from the authority file. Additional texts can be entered by repeating the subfield. </p>

<h4>Key or mode (031 $r) </h4>

<p>The key of the incipit is given according to the list of abbreviations. </p>

<h4>Time signature (031 $o) </h4>

<p>The time signature of the incipit is given here. It is represented as a fraction.</p>

<p>E.g.: </p>
<ul>
	<li>4/4 </li>
	<li>6/8 </li>
</ul>

<p>Mensural signs are written as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>c	=	4/4 </li>
<li>c/	=	2/2 </li>
<li>o	=	3/1 </li>
<li>o/	=	3/2 </li>
</ul>

<p>If the source has, e.g., only "€ž3", it must be completed as "€ž3/4".</p>

<p>If the time signature in the source is obviously wrong, it has to be corrected to match the incipit given. This can be explained in the subfield "General note ($q)".</p>

<p>The time signature must be added if missing in the source. Also in this case, a commentary is required in the "General note ($q)" subfield.</p>

<h4>Clef (031 $g)</h4>

<p>The clef corresponding to the incipit is given in coded form. The first position indicates the type of clef, the 3rd position the staff line. The hyphen in the second position means modern notation. A plus sign means mensural notation.</p>

<p>E.g.: </p> 
<ul>
<li>G-2 = G-clef on the second line </li>
<li>C-3 = C-clef on the 3rd line </li>
<li>C+3 = C-clef on the 3rd line, mensural notation</li>
<li>g-2 = G-clef with octave transposition for tenors on the 2nd line</li>
<li>F-4 = F-clef on the 4th line </li>
</ul>

<h4>Key signature (031 $n)</h4>

<p>Key signatures are identified by the prefix "$". Sharp keys are labeled with "x", flat keys with "b". These signs precede the sharpened or flattened notes.</p>

<p>E.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>$xF = F is sharpened => G major or E minor </li>
<li>$bBE = B and E are flattened => B-flat major or G minor </li>
</ul>

<p>If single accidentals are missing in a key signature, they are added in square brackets. </p>

<p>E.g.: </p>
<ul>
<li>$xFC[G] </li>
</ul>

<p>In the source, only F and C are sharpened. The piece however is clearly in A major. The sharpened G has to be added. </p>

<p><strong>Caution! </strong>In this case, all notes written as "G sharp" in the source have to be written as "G", because they are already sharpened by the key signature!</p>

<p>If no key signature is present, the field remains blank. </p>

<h4>Music incipit (031 $p) </h4>

<p>Music incipits are entered in coded form (Plaine and Easy-code). The following conventions have to be observed: </p>

<p>1. Octave register: </p>
<ul>
<li>'	= 1st octave above middle C </li>
<li>''	= 2nd octave above middle C </li>
<li>'''	= 3rd octave above middle C </li>
<li>,	= 1st octave below middle C </li>
<li>,,	= 2nd octave below middle C </li>
<li>,,,	= 3rd octave below middle C </li>
</ul>

<p>2. Rhythmic values: </p>
<ul>
<li>0	= longa </li>
<li>9	= breve </li>
<li>1	= whole note / semibreve </li>
<li>2	= half-note / minim </li>
<li>4	= quarter-note / crotchet / semiminim </li>
<li>8	= eighth-note / quaver / fusa </li>
<li>6	= 16th-note / semiquaver / semifusa </li>
<li>3	= 32nd-note / demisemiquaver </li>
<li>5	= 64th-note / hemidemisemiquaver </li>
<li>7	= 128th-note </li>
<li>4.	= dotted quarter-note </li>
<li>8..	= double-dotted eighth-note </li>
<li>7.	= neumatic notation </li>
</ul>

<p>3. Accidentals: </p>
<ul>
<li>x	= sharp </li>
<li>xx	= double sharp </li>
<li>b	= flat </li>
<li>bb	= double flat </li>
<li>n	= natural </li>
</ul>

<p>4. Notes (tone letters): </p>
<ul>
<li>C, D, E, F, G, A, B</li>
</ul>

<p>5. Grace notes: </p>
<ul>
<li>g	= acciaccatura (with no rhythmic value, precedes the note) </li>
<li>q	= appoggiatura (with mandatory rhythmic value, precedes the note) </li>
<li> qq...r	= double appoggiatura, slide or multiple appoggiatura (with mandatory rhythmic value) </li>
</ul>

<p>6. Rests:</p>
<ul>
<li>8-	= eighth-note rest</li>
<li>2-	= half-note rest</li>
<li>= or =1	= one bar rest </li>
<li>=35	= 35 bars rest (do not forget the barline!) </li>
</ul>

<p>7. Bar lines:</p>
<ul>
<li>/	= bar line </li>
<li>//	= double bar line </li>
<li>//:	= double bar line with repeat sign on the right </li>
<li>://	= double bar line with repeat sign on the left</li>
<li>://:	= double bar line with repeat sign on the left and on the right </li>
</ul>

<p>8. Other symbols: </p>
<ul>
<li>t	= trill (follows immediately the note) </li>
<li>+	= tie (follows immediately the note, not to be confused with a slur) </li>
<li>()	= fermata (includes only one note or rest; accidentals or octave symbols must be outside the parentheses. See also Irregular rhythmic groupings) </li>
</ul>

<p>9. Beaming: </p>
<ul>
<li>{	= beginning of beaming </li>
<li>}	= end of beaming</li>
<li>&	= conventional beaming (added)</li>
</ul>

<p>10. Irregular rhythmic groupings: </p>
<ul>
<li>(	= beginning of irregular group </li>
<li>)	= end of irregular group </li>
</ul>

<p>Before ‘(’ there must be the total value of the group;</p>
<p>After ‘(’ there must be the rhythmic value of the first note, even if it is equal to that of the group;</p>
<p>Before ‘)’ there must be the number of notes of the group, preceded by ‘;’.</p>

<p> E.g.: </p>
<ul>
<li>8(3ABCDE;5)	= quintuplet, 5 semiquavers in place of a quarter-note</li>
<li>8({3ABCDE};5)	= quintuplet, 5 thirty-seconds in place of an eighth-note, with grouped notes</li>
</ul>

<p>The triplet is a special case of irregular groups. It should be coded as follows:</p>
<ul>
       <li>8(6ABC;3) or 8({6ABC};3)</li>
</ul>
It is instead possible to code it as:</p>
<ul>
       <li>(6ABC) or ({6ABC})</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Caution!</strong> The rhythmic value inside parentheses is mandatory.</p>

<p>11. Abbreviated writing:</p>

<p>11.1 Repetition of notes</p>
<ul>
	<li>! = beginning and end of notes that will be repeated </li>
	<li>f = repetition mark of the notes included within !...! </li>
</ul>

<p>The group will be repeated as many times as the ‘f’ is found after the second ‘!’; the repetition is possible only inside the same bar.</p>

<p>E.g.: </p>
<ul>
<li>!{'8ABAG}!ff 	repeat twice</li>
</ul>

<p>11.2 Repetition of bars</p>
<ul>
<li>i = repeat last bar </li>
</ul>

<p>The symbol ‘i’ repeats the last bar; it must always be included within bar lines.</p>

<p>E.g.: </p>
<ul>
<li>'4ABAG/i/i/ 	repeat bar twice</li>
</ul>

<p>11.3 Rhythmic model</p>

<p>When the same rhythmic figures are repeated, a group of rhythmic values can be assumed as a model, in the following manner:</p>

<p>E.g.: </p>
<ul>
<li>instead of {'8.A6B''8C}{8.D6E8F}</li>
<li>the code can be '8.68{AB''C}{DEF}</li>
</ul>

<p>The rhythmic model ends when a new rhythmic value appears.</P>

<p>12. Change of clef, key signature, time signature: </p>

<p>The three elements (%, $, @) can be used individually and collectively within the musical context. They are followed by the new measure, accidentals or clef symbols. They must be followed by a space.</p>

<strong>Caution!</strong> The introductory symbols are mandatory.</p>

<p>E.g.: </p>
<ul>
	<li>%C-1 '2A</li>
    <li>%C-1 $xFC '8B</li>
	<li>@3/2 '1C</li>
    <li>$nBE $xFC</li>
</ul>

<p>13. Abbreviations </p>

<p>Notational abbreviations like tremolo, slash, etc. must be replaced by their extensive notation.</p>

<p>E.g.: </p>
<ul>
<li>slash on D = {'8 DDDD} </li>
</ul>


<h4>Coded validity note (031 $s) </h4>
<ul>
	<li>"?"	There is a mistake in the incipit that has not been corrected. </li>
	<li>"+"	There is a mistake in the incipit that has been corrected. </li>
	<li>"t"	The incipit has been transcribed (e.g. from mensural notation)</li>
</ul>

<h4>General note (031 $q) </h4>

<p>Here more comments can be added, such as the pitch of transposing instruments occurring in the incipit. </p>
