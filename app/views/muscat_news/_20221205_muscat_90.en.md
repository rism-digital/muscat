## Welcome to the new Muscat release 9.0, winter edition!

This new major release brings some exciting features, in particular regarding Works.

* Replacement of Works with reduced WorkNodes records that connect directly to GND works from the German National Library. GND is searchable directly from the WorkNode interface and WorkNode records can be created from GND works directly within Muscat.
* A child record of a collection or composite volume cannot be deleted unless the 774 link is removed in the parent record.
* Errors in saving/deleting sources now redirect to the problematic source and not to the source list.
* Authority Merge (for Editors) now does not create duplicate tags when merging two records.


This release of Muscat also includes many more enhancements. Please refer to the [changelog](https://github.com/rism-ch/muscat/blob/master/CHANGELOG) for the complete list of changes.
