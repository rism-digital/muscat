## Welcome to the new Muscat release 8.2!

* Source type (593): This field was completely revised. It is now in two parts ($a and $b) and separates material type from content type. Categorizing and searching sources is also now easier. 
* Usernames: Users can log in with their email address or a different username. The username is initially set automatically but it can be changed in the user setting page.
* Folders now expire and are automatically deleted after six months. Users will receive an email reminding them to renew their folders.
* Folder expiration status is now shown in the Dashboard.
* Comments are also now shown in the Dashboard.

This release of Muscat also includes many more enhancements. Please refer to the [changelog](https://github.com/rism-digital/muscat/blob/master/CHANGELOG) for the complete list of changes.
