## Muscat 9.3

Muscat 9.3 brings many enhancements and some new features.

* The field Additional Institution (710 $c in Sources and Secondary Literature) is linked to the Places authority file. You can directly add a location when adding a new institution.
* Adding a new place in 710 $c will also add this place to the corresponding new authority record in Institutions.
* More fields are now included in the CSV export of folders.
* Text incipits (031 $t), Total instrumentation (594 $b), and Profession or Function in Personal names (550 $a) have an improved autocomplete which properly removes deleted items.
* The column "Name and location" on the main page on Institutions now displays both Institution Name and Subordinate Unit (110 $a and $b).

This release of Muscat also includes many more enhancements. Please refer to the [changelog](https://github.com/rism-ch/muscat/blob/master/CHANGELOG) for the complete list of changes.
